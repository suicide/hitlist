This is a test project for http://meh.get-it.us

It is a simple Spring + Maven Webapp. It is used to
demonstrate Selenium testing combined with test data
injection using JMX.

For this to work you need to start the application in
an servlet container, e.g. tomcat, and run the unit tests
separately as they need to connect to a running insance
of the app.
